Experiment 4 is divided into 3 parts:
README - Java Collection Framework and Multithreading (Experiment 4)

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This experiment covers the Java Collection Framework and Multithreading concepts. It includes three levels of programming tasks: Easy, Medium, and Hard, aimed at implementing different collections and thread management techniques in Java.

ðŸ“‚ Topics Covered
	â€¢	Collections in Java: ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, TreeMap, HashSet
	â€¢	Multithreading in Java
	â€¢	Thread synchronization
	â€¢	Thread priority
	â€¢	Thread lifecycle

ðŸ’¡ Project Tasks

ðŸ”¹ Easy Level

Task: Implement an ArrayList that stores employee details (ID, Name, Salary). Users should be able to:
	â€¢	Add an employee
	â€¢	Update employee details
	â€¢	Remove an employee
	â€¢	Search for an employee

ðŸ“Œ Key Concept: ArrayList usage for dynamic storage.

ðŸ”¹ Medium Level

Task: Create a program to store and collect cards based on a given symbol using the Collection interface. Users should be able to:
	â€¢	Add new cards to the collection
	â€¢	Retrieve all cards of a specific symbol

ðŸ“Œ Key Concept: Using Collections to manage and filter data.

ðŸ”¹ Hard Level

Task: Develop a ticket booking system with synchronized threads to:
	â€¢	Prevent double booking of seats (Thread synchronization)
	â€¢	Use thread priority to ensure VIP bookings are processed first

ðŸ“Œ Key Concept: Thread synchronization and priority management.

ðŸ›  How to Run the Programs
	1.	Install Java (JDK 8+): Ensure you have Java installed.
	2.	Compile the Java Files:

javac FileName.java


	3.	Run the Program:

java FileName

ðŸ”— Additional Notes
	â€¢	The Easy Level demonstrates the fundamental use of collections.
	â€¢	The Medium Level focuses on Collection Interface manipulation.
	â€¢	The Hard Level explores multithreading and synchronization.

âœ… By completing this experiment, you will gain hands-on experience in working with collections and multithreading in Java.
